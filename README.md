# CEA-INPE
CEA stands for "Chemical Equilibrium with Applications" and NASA means (for those who don't already know) "National Aeronautics and Space Administration".

## According to program's home page (original text):
---
"The NASA Computer program CEA (Chemical Equilibrium with Applications) calculates chemical equilibrium compositions and properties of complex mixtures. Applications include assigned thermodynamic states, theoretical rocket performance, Chapman-Jouguet detonations, and shock-tube parameters for incident and reflected shocks.
...
The program is written in ANSI standard FORTRAN by Bonnie J. McBride and Sanford Gordon..."

## Some history now (out of curiosity):
---
Original FORTRAN (or FORmula TRANslator) is a language created in 1954(!!!), and released commercially in 1957. The start of the CEA program took place when not even NASA was called NASA.

...

To make a long story short, many calculations were incorporated into the program, which was renamed CEA in 1994 (and remains to this day).

...

Fun fact: FORTRAN is the oldest commercial programming language. It has 11 revisions and improvements, and the lastest one was launched in 2018!!!

## Back to today
---
The current version of CEA uses a Java applet to create a graphical interface to use the FORTRAN code (which is a batch-program style) to run, but it has no restrictions and field validations, and with that need was born CEA-INPE.

CEA-INPE is a brand-new graphical user interface to use with CEA-NASA's core program.

Modest minimum system requirements are:
- Windows XP (SP3) compatible operating system - in this case mail me at ricardo.andrade@inpe.br for me to provide another way to install, since MSI package in Windows XP is big trouble.
- .Net Framework 3.5 installed
- 4MB disk free space (less than your high-res photo on desktop wallpaper)
- 12MB free RAM (even the first iPhone has it)

***
- UPDATE! With proud that I announce CEA-INPE IS compatible with Windows-that-is-not-Windows OS: ***ReactOS***. It's a unimaginable programming breakthrough for me!

!

Just install the package downloaded (virus-free! If your antivirus says it is lying.) and run with the shortcut created in Start Menu, or on Desktop.
Happy calculations!

- 1.99 - damn misplaced letters - checked all interface again!
- 2.0 - bug hunting
- 2.01 to 2.02 - bug smashing
- 2.03 to 2.13 - redesigned user-reactant window, with new constraints
- 2.14 - first REALLY public version (forget all the past! Version history is merely informative)          <- we are here!
    (*The Three Stooges (Only, Omit and Insert tabs) still not working properly. Sorry.*)
