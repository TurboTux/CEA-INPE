# CEA-INPE
CEA stands for "Chemical Equilibrium with Applications" and NASA means (for those who don't already know) "National Aeronautics and Space Administration".

According to program's home page (original text):
---
"The NASA Computer program CEA (Chemical Equilibrium with Applications) calculates chemical equilibrium compositions and properties of complex mixtures. Applications include assigned thermodynamic states, theoretical rocket performance, Chapman-Jouguet detonations, and shock-tube parameters for incident and reflected shocks.
...
The program is written in ANSI standard FORTRAN by Bonnie J. McBride and Sanford Gordon..."


Some history now (out of curiosity):
---
Original FORTRAN (or FORmula TRANslator) is a language created in 1954(!!!), and released commercially in 1957. The start of the CEA program took place when not even NASA was called NASA.

...

To make a long story short, many calculations were incorporated into the program, which was renamed CEA in 1994 (and remains to this day).

...

Fun fact: FORTRAN is the oldest commercial programming language. It has 11 revisions and improvements, and the lastest one was launched in 2018!!!



Back to today
---
The current version of CEA uses a Java applet to create a graphical interface to use the FORTRAN code (which is a batch-program style) to run, but it has no restrictions and field validations, and with that need was born CEA-INPE.

CEA-INPE is a brand-new graphical user interface to use use CEA-NASA's core program.

Modest minimum system requirements are:
- Windows XP-compatible operating system
- .Net Framework 3.5 installed
- 4MB disk free space (less than your high-res photo on desktop wallpaper)
- 12MB free RAM (even the first iPhone has it)

Just install the package downloaded (virus-free! If your antivirus says it is lying.) and run with the shortcut created in Start Menu, or on Desktop.
Happy calculations!
